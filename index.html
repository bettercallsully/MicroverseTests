    <h3 id="headline">Here is The Early Life of Michael Jackson</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Michael Joseph Jackson</strong> 
            <li><strong>(August 29, 1958 – June 25, 2009)</strong></li>
             Was an American singer, songwriter, and dancer. Dubbed the <strong>"King of Pop"</strong>, he is regarded as one of the most significant cultural figures of the 20th century. Through stage and video performances, he popularized complicated dance moves such as the moonwalk, to which he gave the name, and the robot. His sound and style have influenced artists of various genres, and his contributions to music, dance, and fashion, along with his publicized personal life, made him a global figure in popular culture for over four decades. Jackson is the most awarded artist in the history of popular music.</li>
        <li>The eighth child of the Jackson family, Jackson made his professional debut in 1964 with his elder brothers Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, and Marlon as a member of the Jackson 5. Jackson began his solo career.</li>
        <li>in <strong>1971</strong> while at Motown Records, and rose to solo stardom with his fifth studio album <strong>Off the Wall (1979)</strong> during the peak of the disco era. By the early 1980s, Jackson became a dominant figure in popular music.</li>
        <li>By the early,<strong> 1980's </strong><strong>Jackson</strong> became a dominant figure in popular music. His music videos, including those for <strong>"Beat It"</strong>,<strong>"Billie Jean"</strong>, and <strong>"Thriller"</strong> from his sixth studio album Thriller <strong>(1982)</strong>, are credited with breaking racial barriers and transforming the medium into an art form and promotional tool.</li>
        <li>Starting in the late <strong>1980s</strong>, Jackson became a figure of controversy and speculation due to his changing appearance, relationships, behavior and lifestyle. In <strong>1993</strong> , he was accused of sexually abusing the child of a family friend. The lawsuit was settled out of court, and Jackson was not indicted. In <strong>2005</strong> , he was tried and acquitted of further child sexual abuse allegations and several other charges. Four years later, while preparing for a series of comeback concerts, This Is It, Jackson died from an overdose of propofol administered by his personal physician, Conrad Murray. Fans around the world expressed their grief, and Jackson's public memorial service was broadcast live. In August <strong>2009</strong> , the Los Angeles County Coroner ruled that Jackson's death was a homicide, and Murray was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in November <strong>2011</strong>. Seven years later, the documentary Leaving Neverland, which detailed allegations of child sexual abuse, led to another media backlash against Jackson.</li>
        <li>Beginning in May <strong>2002</strong>, a documentary film crew led by Martin Bashir followed Jackson for several months. The documentary, broadcast in February 2003 as Living with Michael Jackson, showed Jackson holding hands and discussing sleeping arrangements with a 12-year-old boy. He also said that he saw nothing wrong with having sleepovers with minors and sharing his bed and bedroom with various people, which aroused controversy. He insisted that the sleepovers were not sexual and that his words had been misunderstood.
            On December 18, 2003, Santa Barbara authorities charged Jackson with seven counts of child molestation and two counts of intoxicating a minor with alcoholic drinks. Jackson denied the allegations and pleaded not guilty. The People v. Jackson trial began on January 31, 2005, in Santa Maria, California, and lasted until the end of May. Jackson found the experience stressful and it affected his health. If convicted, he would have faced up to 20 years in prison. On June 13, 2005, Jackson was acquitted on all counts. After the trial, he became reclusive and moved to Bahrain as a guest of Sheikh Abdullah. Jermaine Jackson later said the family had planned to send Michael there had he been convicted.</li>
        <li> <strong>On June 25, 2009</strong>, less than three weeks before the first This Is It show was due to begin in London, with all concerts sold out, Jackson died from cardiac arrest. Conrad Murray, his personal physician, had given Jackson various medications to help him sleep at his rented mansion in Holmby Hills, Los Angeles. Paramedics received a 911 call at 12:22 pm Pacific time (19:22 UTC), and arrived three minutes later. Jackson was not breathing and CPR was performed. Resuscitation efforts continued en route to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, and for more than an hour after arriving there, but were unsuccessful, and he was pronounced dead at 2:26 pm Pacific time (21:26 UTC).</li>
